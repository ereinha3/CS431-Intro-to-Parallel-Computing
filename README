This repository consists of the curricular work for CS431 Introduction to Parallel Computing.
Material covered includes hardware optimization, OpemMP programming, CUDA programming, and MPI programming.

Homework 1: Parallelized Calculation of Pi with OpenMP
	- Serial Version
	- Parallel Integration method with OpenMP
	- Parallel Monte Carlo with OpenMP

Homework 2: Parallelized Pre-Fix Sum with OpenMP
	- Serial sum is O(n) time
	- Pre-fix sum is O(nlogn) but allows for parallelization

Homework 3: Parallelized Sparse Matrix Vector Multiplication (SpMV) using OpenMP
	- Convert COO format to CSR format
	- Calculate SPMV with COO format in serial
	- Calculate SPMV with COO format using OpenMP
	- Calculate SPMV with CSR format in serial
	- Calculate SPMV with CSR format using OpenMP

Homework 4:
