# CS431 - Introduction to Parallel Computing

This repository contains the curricular work for CS431 Introduction to Parallel Computing. The course covers various aspects of parallel computing including hardware optimization, OpenMP programming, CUDA programming, and MPI programming.

## Repository Structure

- `homework01/`: Parallelized Calculation of Pi using OpenMP
- `homework02/`: Parallelized Pre-Fix Sum using OpenMP
- `homework03/`: Parallelized Sparse Matrix Vector Multiplication (SpMV) using OpenMP
- `homework04/`: [To be completed]
- `homework05/`: [To be completed]

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Run the setup script:
   ```bash
   chmod +x RUNTHISAFTERYOUPULL.sh
   ./RUNTHISAFTERYOUPULL.sh
   ```

## Homework Assignments

### Homework 1: Parallelized Calculation of Pi
- Implements different methods to calculate Pi using OpenMP
- Includes both serial and parallel versions
- Features integration method and Monte Carlo simulation
- Located in `homework01/`

### Homework 2: Parallelized Pre-Fix Sum
- Implements parallel prefix sum algorithm using OpenMP
- Compares serial (O(n)) vs parallel (O(log n)) implementations
- Located in `homework02/`

### Homework 3: Sparse Matrix Vector Multiplication
- Implements SpMV using different formats (COO and CSR)
- Includes both serial and OpenMP parallel versions
- Features format conversion and performance comparison
- Located in `homework03/`

## Running the Code

Each homework directory contains its own `autoRun.sh` script that can be used to compile and run the code. To run any homework:

1. Navigate to the homework directory
2. Make the run script executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x autoRun.sh
   ```
3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   ./autoRun.sh
   ```

## Requirements

- C/C++ compiler with OpenMP support
- Make build system
- For detailed requirements, check individual homework directories
